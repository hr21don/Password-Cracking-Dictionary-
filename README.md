## What is Password cracking?
In a general sense, password cracking is the process of using an application program to identify and recover passwords from a computer or network resource.

## What does this mean?

With this information, malicious actors can undertake a range of criminal activities where they can gain unauthorised access to restricted resources for identity theft and fraud. 

## What makes a strong password?
Nowadays, password crackers can decipher passwords in a matter of days or hours, depending on how weak or strong the password is.  To make a password stronger and more difficult to uncover, a plaintext password should adhere to the following 6 rules!

### 1. Be at least 12 characters long:
*  The shorter a password is, the easier and faster it will be cracked.

### 2. Combine letters and a variety of characters.
*  Using numbers and special characters, such as periods and commas, increases the number of possible combinations.

### 3. Avoid reusing a password. 
* If a password is cracked, then a person with malicious intent could use that same password to easily access other password-protected accounts the victim owns.

### 4. Pay attention to password strength indicators.
* Some password-protected systems include a password strength meter, which is a scale that tells users when they have created a strong password.

### 5. Avoid easy-to-guess phrases and common passwords.

* Weak passwords can be a name, a pet's name or a birthdate -- something personally identifiable. Short and easily predictable patterns, like 123456, password or qwerty, also are weak passwords.

### 6. Use encryption (2FA).

* Enable 2 Factor Autentication to secure your passwords on all your accounts. 
* Take advantage of password creation tools and managers.
